%description

  Short GtkEntry for file autocompletion + main.cc that does the needed stuff
  for running programs.  This is intended as a replacement to grun, which
  (sorry) sucks.  The idea comes from the KDE Window Manager (ALT-F2 in KDE).
  Though, GNOME is better :)

%changelog
* Sun Aug 03 2003 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro> 0.9-2
- fixed a parsing bug in the "run command" function

* Sun Jun 22 2003 Marius FERARU <altblue@n0i.net> 0.9-0.n0i
- version 0.9

* Sat Jun 14 2003 Marius FERARU <altblue@n0i.net> 0.8.1-1.n0i
- rebuild on RHL9

* Sat Aug 17 2002 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- Some bugs fixed, specifically the behavior of END/HOME keys (or C-E, C-A),
  and the major one: you could not run a file that has an extension handler
  with some other program than the extension handler :)

* Fri Aug 16 2002 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- Fixed bug: filenames can now contain white spaces (will be backslash-ed)
- New feature: can specify application handler per file extension, so you
  can directly type the name of some .cpp file and emacs will show up :)
  see config file for details.
- New feature: can automatically simulate a TAB press after some timeout.
  Check config file for details, key "TabTimeout" (0 to disable).
- New feature: you can now always use "system" for running programs
  (specify --enable-system at configure).

* Fri Oct 19 2001 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- Fixed bug with sorting of completion list
- Fixed bug with URL handling
- New parameter: list of execs to be always run in terminal
- New feature: last history line appears directly in edit line, selected

* Wed Aug 01 2001 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- Programs are now executed using execv.  We don't use system anymore, thus
  avoiding forking another shell.
- gmrun.spec gets now generated automagically, at ./configure.

* Sun Jul 22 2001 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- added "!" history backward search; like in bash, it finds the last command
  which begins with the entered text.
- CTRL-R / CTRL-S don't show two identical consecutive records.

* Thu Jul 19 2001 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- added history search capabilities (CTRL-R / CTRL-S, like in bash / Emacs)
- small bug fixes

* Fri Jun 29 2001 Mihai Bazon <mishoo@infoiasi.ro>
- history size configurable from config file
- window appears directly where it should (no more flicker)

- updated to version 0.5.3 and took over to 0.5.31

* Wed May 03 2001 Marius Feraru <altblue@n0i.net>
- updated to version 0.2.5 and took over to 0.2.51:
	* configuration file with 2 options for now:
		'Terminal' and 'Width'
	* added some more (and hopefully more useful) documentation:
		README.hints, README.gmrunrc and README.icewm

* Wed May 03 2001 Marius Feraru <altblue@n0i.net>
